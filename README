##### Background:
STCP provides a connection-oriented, in-order, full duplex 
end-to-end delivery mechanism.
We assume the network is reliable, and therefore do not account 
for dropped packets, reordering, retransmissions, and timeouts in 
the underlying network layer.

##### Design Decisions:
1. Not all possible states were enumerated.
For example, I chose not to have an ACK_SENT state.
I found that there was no use in having more states than necessary
to do our basic functionality, so I didn't bother wasting lines on
something that could be easily added later.

I also chose to have multiple states during the setup process 
(SYN_SENT, SYN_RECEIVED, SYN_ACK_SENT, SYN_ACK_RECEIVED)
instead of one called CSTATE_ESTABLISHING.
This made it easier to track what calls had gone through properly,
and keeps the code readable.

2. Recieve and Send Buffer structs hold Segment struct
3. context_t tracks state, sequence numbers, reciever window size, and buffers.

##### Strengths:
1. Generic functions for handshake packet creation, sending, and waiting.
2. Buffers have sliding window.

##### Weaknesses:
1. double free() at connection close.
2. No check to set isDUP upon packet reciept.
